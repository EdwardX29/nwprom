# NWProm [web app](nwprom.herokuapp.com)
Prototype website for anonymous prom dance matchmaking using Django. Allowed users to find a prom partner without embarassment. Users enter their prospective prom dates into an input and a match is made if the date reciprocates. All inputs are concealed as long until a match is made.

## Technology
Website built with Django MVT with Bootstrap. Utilized Google SSO (single sign-on) for authentication and name validation. Heroku for deployment and PostgreSQL as database. 

## Installation
Be sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all of the necessary packages.
